# Fake-News-Detector

Today, the technological advancement has invented a virtual world of social media, where information of happenings over the world gets circulated within seconds. But of-course, many a times fake roumors can also spread like fire over these platforms and can create unnecessary panic.

This model is trained such that it aims to predict whether a news is fake or not. It uses TfidfVectorizer which is a model that takes the frequencies of the words into account. After the data is fitted on TfidfVectorizer, I trained it with multiple classifiers to compare and find out which fits the model best. It generally saves quite a time when we are not sure as to which model might suit the data best.
